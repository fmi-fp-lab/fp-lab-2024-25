-- Use `error :: String -> a` when you need to error out.

-- | EXERCISE
-- Implement reading an `Integer` from stdin.
-- Use `readMaybe :: Read a => String -> Maybe a`
getNumber :: IO Integer

-- | EXERCISE
-- Implement reading a `Bool` from stdin.
getBool :: IO Bool
getBool = undefined

-- | EXERCISE
-- Implement a function which runs the provided action when
-- the given `Maybe` is a nothing, and otherwise returns the value within the `Just`.
-- This is actually a common bit in both `getBool` and `getNumber`
-- and is an overall very useful function.
whenNothing :: Maybe a -> IO a -> IO a
whenNothing = undefined

-- | EXERCISE
-- `getNumber` and `getBool` are practically the same.
-- We can generalise them to use the `Read` type class, so that they
-- work for any type which has an instance of `Read`.
-- Try to use `whenNothing` here.
--
-- Note that sometimes when using this function you'll need to specify a type annotation,
-- because the compiler will not be able to figure out what exactly type you want to read.
-- e.g. `x <- readLn :: IO Int` to read an `Int`, or similarly you could do `x :: Int <- readLn`
-- readLn :: ??
-- readLn = undefined

-- | EXERCISE
-- Same as `readLn`, but don't error out, returning a `Maybe` instead.

-- | EXERCISE
-- We're going to implement a very simplified version of the Hangman game.
--
-- The `startHangman` function takes in an argument a path to a file containing a dictionary of words.
-- The dictionary is expected to be newline seperated for each word, and to have at least 100 words.
-- You can find such a dictionary in directory of this file called `words.txt`
--
-- After doing that, it prompts the user for a number between 0 and 99, inclusive, and then
-- uses that number as an index into the dictionary to pick a word for the game hangman.
-- If the user errors a number which is outside that range, we should prompt them again (`untilJustM` is useful here)
--
-- You can use `lines :: String -> [String]` to split up the dictionary.
-- You can use `(!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a` to index the dictionary.
--
--
-- The `playHangman guessedSoFar target` function is the actual "gameplay" we're going to implement.
-- In it, we keep an argument `guessedSoFar` as "state" for the letters we've guessed so far,
-- as well as which the target word is.
-- On each turn of the game, we must
-- 1. Print out the "guessed" version of the target word, i.e., we display only letters which the player has
--    guessed so far, "censoring" the others with some symbol (e.g. '-' or '_')
-- 1. Ask the player to make a guess for what the word is
-- 2. If the player guesses the word, we terminate the game and print a cheerful message
-- 3. Otherwise, we continue playing the game, extending the list of guessed letters.

-- EXERCISE:
-- Extend the hangman game to support a turn limit.
-- If the player wants to win, they must guess the word before the turn limit.

-- EXERCISE:
-- Extend the hangman game so it supports entering either a letter, or a word,
-- closer to the actual game of hangman.
-- You can choose whatever format you like for the input, for example it could be a prefix
-- indicating what was entered, e.g.
-- w:<some word here> and c:<some char here>
-- or
-- guess:<some word here> and <char>
