-- Quoting: <<EOQ
-- A note on evaluation order: the expression @seq a b@ does not guarantee that @a@ will be evaluated before @b@.
-- The only guarantee given by @seq@ is that the both @a@ and @b@ will be evaluated before seq returns a value.
-- In particular, this means that @b@ *may* be evaluated before @a@.
-- It also means that if you entirely ignore the result of @seq a b@, neither @a@ nor @b@ will be evaluated,
-- for example in @const 5 (seq undefined undefined)@.

-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> take 10 nats
-- [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

-- EXERCISE
-- Generate an infinite list of numbers, starting with the given number, with the given interval between each numbe.
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> take 10 $ fromThen 0 1
-- [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
-- >>> take 20 $ fromThen 0 1
-- [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]

-- EXERCISE
-- Implement a list of all the factorial numbers
-- Use a where or let to "cache" the current number, so we don't do all the multiplications every time.
-- i.e. if we've already calculated 5!, we can simply multiply the result by 6, we don't need to calculate 5! again.
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> take 10 facts
-- [1,1,2,6,24,120,720,5040,40320,362880]
facts :: [Integer]
facts = undefined
  where
    go = undefined

-- EXERCISE
-- "Caching foldl"
-- It's sometimes useful to have all the "intermediate" results of a fold. It's also helpful for debugging sometimes.
-- Implement a version of foldl that returns all of the intermediate results it has.
-- These are called "scans" in the Haskell standard library.
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> scanl (+) 0 [1..10]
-- [0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55]
scanl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> [b]
scanl = undefined

-- EXERCISE
-- Use scanl to implement facts.
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> take 10 factsScanl
-- [1,1,2,6,24,120,720,5040,40320,362880,3628800]

-- EXERCISE
-- Implement a list of all the fibonacci numbers.
-- Use the following idea:
-- The fibonacci numbers start with 0 1
-- To generate the next fibonacci number, we need to sum the previous two, so assuming we already have
-- fibs :: [Integer]
-- that would mean summing the head of fibs with the head of the tail of fibs
-- zipWith will be useful here.
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> take 10 fibs
-- [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
fibs :: [Integer]
fibs = undefined

-- EXERCISE
-- Idea:
-- We can get the all the primes with the following algorithm.
-- Let's start with all the numbers >=2
-- The current number - call it x - is prime (this is true in the beginning - x = 2 is prime) - leave it in our list
-- All of the other numbers that are divisible by x aren't prime - filter them out
-- This is called the sieve of Eratosthenes
-- Implement this for a given input list
-- Now all we need to do is apply it to all the natural numbers >=2 to get a list of all the primes.
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> take 10 $ primes
-- [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]
-- >>> take 20 $ primes
-- [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71]

-- EXERCISE
-- Infinitely repeat a list
-- >>> take 7 $ cycle [1,2,3]
-- [1,2,3,1,2,3,1]
cycle :: [a] -> [a]
cycle = undefined

-- Let's consider the following problem:
-- We have a "circle" of n people. We have an integer k.
-- We repeat the following procedure, starting from the first person, until there is only one left:
--
-- "Kill" the kth person. Repeat this, "starting" from the k+1th person, i.e. we start indexing from the k+1th person.
--
-- Example execution for n = 5, k = 2:
-- 1 2 3 4 5 (start)
-- 1 2 4 5 (we kill 3, since 0 + 2 = 2)
-- 2 4 5 (we kill 1, since 4 + 2 = 6, circling back to 1)
-- 2 4
-- 4
--
-- The question is, given arguments n and k, what's the number of the final person left. (4 in the example above)
--
-- This is called the josephus problem - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem.
--
-- Your task is to implement @jos :: Integer -> Int -> Integer@
-- which takes n and k, and returns the last surviving person.
--
-- Your hint is to use `cycle` to express our circle, and then to drop and filter things from it.
-- E.g. the representation of our circle for n = 5 would be [0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3,4...]
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> jos 5 2
-- 4
-- >>> jos 10 4
-- 3
-- >>> jos 10 8
-- 7
-- >>> map (\(x,y) -> (x, y, jos x y)) [(x, y) | x <- [2..5], y <- [2..5]]
